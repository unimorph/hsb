# Upper Sorbian (hsb)

## Data
The Upper Sorbian dataset contains 310 word forms and 400 lemmas. The data source is the corpus compiled by [https://www.serbski-institut.de/en/Institute/] (the Sorbian Institute) and [https://www.witaj-sprachzentrum.de/](Witaj Language Center) in Germany, that was used as a training model for an unsupervised MT task (Fraser, 2020). All conjugated parts of speech existing in the language are presented in the dataset. Adjectives, when plural or dual, are marked with case only, otherwise have gender marking, according to Upper-Sorbian grammar.
